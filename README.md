Directory upload files to directories on apache servers with 777 permissions or higher

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>
Put these in a directory on your server, and modify the username and password in index.php. The main screen looks like this:<br>
</p>

<p>
Test your username and password. If they work, it will log you in to this screen:<br>
<img src="http://edwinfinch.com/screenshots/2014-10-11%2016_51_23-File%20Upload.png"><br><br>

Choose a file, and upload it to a directory with proper permissions (777 or higher works for me).<br>
If the operation was a success, you will see an output similar to this:<br>

The file link redirects you to that file. Feel free to modify this as you wish and whatnot. MIT license.
